# Daysie

Communal/distributed days since last incident counter
Or last time we had to evacuate (for the hundredth time)
Or last time your teacher did something funny
Or last time your friend forgot their lunch and you had to give them your bagel (you know who you are)

## Minimum Viable Product

counter
reset button
- makes you sign in with google
- confirms you want to reset

display title
shareable link
remembers owner, contributors

## Adding More
showing the updated count in an embed
- generate a png
- prevent it from being cached too much?
owner being able to edit
- title
- entries
- banning people who spam
- quantization to days, hours, etc.
submitting a message with the incident
- maybe a set number specified by the owner?
- maybe just puts your name and pfp with the message
different layouts
- use the number in a sentence with template (do we want %d, {{}}, $date, something else...?)
a timeline of incidents
themes :)
likelyhood of an incident today meter
a way to export the data
